# Binary System Counter using Arduino
This repository contains a binary system counter that counts from 0 to 32 using Arduino. The counter is implemented using the Arduino IDE and can be uploaded to any Arduino board.

# How it works
The binary system counter consists of 6 LEDs, each representing a bit in the binary count. The counter starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each button press until it reaches 32, at which point it resets back to 0.

# Getting started
To use the binary system counter, you will need an Arduino board and the Arduino IDE. Here are the steps to upload the code to your Arduino board:

- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
- Open the binary_system_counter.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
- Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
- Select your Arduino board and port in the Arduino IDE.
- Upload the code to your Arduino board.
# Pinout
The LEDs are connected to the following pins on the Arduino board:

1. LED0: Pin 2
2. LED1: Pin 3
3. LED2: Pin 4
4. LED3: Pin 5
5. LED4: Pin 6
6. LED5: Pin 7
